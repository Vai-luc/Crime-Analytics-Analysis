# Crime Analytics with Python 🕵️‍♂️📊

This project focuses on analyzing crime data to uncover meaningful insights and patterns using Python-based data science techniques. By applying exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and basic predictive modeling, it provides a foundation for understanding crime trends across different regions, types, and timelines.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Clean, preprocess, and explore real-world crime data
- Identify trends by location, time, and crime type
- Visualize data with interactive and static charts
- Discover high-crime zones and seasonal patterns
- Explore correlation between socioeconomic or demographic factors and crime rates (if included)

## 🔍 Key Features

- Missing value handling and feature engineering
- Visualizations: heatmaps, histograms, time series plots, bar charts, geospatial maps (if applicable)
- Trend detection by month, year, state, or crime category
- Clustering or pattern recognition (optional: KMeans, correlation analysis)
- Scalable and modular notebook structure for extension

## 📁 Dataset

- Publicly available crime data (Kaggle, government portals, etc.)
- Typical fields: `State`, `District`, `Crime_Type`, `Year`, `Cases_Reported`



## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional) Folium / GeoPandas for mapping
- Scikit-learn (for clustering/prediction)

## 📊 Sample Insights

- Top 5 states with highest total crimes
- Monthly crime patterns: spikes in specific seasons
- Correlation between unemployment and crime (optional)
- Districts with recurring patterns of a specific crime type

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vai-luc/crime-analytics.git
cd crime-analytics
````

2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Crime-Analytics.ipynb
```

## ✅ Conclusion

This project showcases how data science can play a crucial role in public safety by transforming raw crime reports into actionable intelligence. The notebook is designed for modular expansion, including predictive analytics or dashboard integration.
